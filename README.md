**Features**
1. Player vs Player mode
2. Player vs AI mode (Minimax and Backtracking)
3. Unbeatable AI opponent
4. Simple and intuitive console interface

**Prerequisites**
To build and run this project, you need:
1. C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
2. CMake (for building)

**Gameplay**
The game supports two modes :
1. Player vs Player: Two players take turns making moves.
2. Player vs AI: Play against an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm with backtracking.
Follow on-screen instructions to make moves during the game.

**Algorithm Overview**
The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm with backtracking to determine the best move. Minimax is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games where the goal is to find the optimal move for the player, assuming that the opponent will also play optimally. Backtracking explores all possible moves and their outcomes, enabling the AI to make the best decision.
